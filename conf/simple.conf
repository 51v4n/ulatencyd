# This are simple rule files that allow you to add flags to processes
# Each rule is a line
#
# [match]        [flagename]   [[attribute]=[value]|...]
#
# match:
#
# /full/path        path starting with / are absolute exe paths
# basename          matches the last part of the command
# re_exe:[regexp]   regular expression used on the path of the executable
# re_cmd:[regexp]   regular expression on full command line
# re_base:[regexp]  regular expression on basename
#
# Example:
# /path/to/my/exe     user.media
# python              test.useless    value=1   threshold=10212
#
# See https://github.com/poelzi/ulatencyd/wiki/flags.md for the convention
# on the flag names

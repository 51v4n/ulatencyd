TODO:
- add process affinity api (maybe better done with cgroups cpuset)
- add chrt interface for realtime attributes etc

- upstart plugin
- dbus interface
  - interface for notification of rough processes, when processes or groups of them
    where killed and why
  - interface for user wishes pinning to different parameters (cli)
- rules rules rules ;-)

- maybe: using audit linux system to watch process creation/deletion auditctl or more interessting syscalls


UNLIKLY:
- having a copy of libproc is very ugly, but currently it does not export enough symbols
